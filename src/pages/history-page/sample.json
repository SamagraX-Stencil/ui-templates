        "response": "To enhance the productivity of millet crops, you can consider establishing diverse seed centers for easy access to quality seeds, implementing improved agronomic practices, utilizing appropriate farm mechanization through custom hiring centers, provide training to farmers through community resource persons, and promoting millets in urban and small towns. As for improving the harvesting of millets, it is recommended to wait until the ears turn yellowish-brown before harvesting, heap the harvested ears and cover them with ragi straw for 2-3 days before threshing, and separate grains are winnowed and cleaned. Farmers can also utilize ragi threshers developed by OUAT, which are both power and bullock operated to improve grain quality and save time.",

        "response": "To control termites in sugarcane, you can spray Bifenthrin @ 30 ml or Fipronil @ 15ml Chloropyriphos @30 ml in 15 liter of water. Termites attack setts, shoots, canes and also stubbles. They gain entry through the cut ends or through buds of the setts and feed on the soft tissues. The tunnel excavated is filled with soil, which affects germination and ultimately the cane yield.",
